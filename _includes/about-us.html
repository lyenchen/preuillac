              <p>In 1869, Edmond Addé, recognised by the France agriculture sector with a title of “ Knight of the field”, succeeded Château Preuillac. From Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon to Semillon and Muscat grapes, Edmond Addé works on the selection of premium grapes varieties and development of the vineyard. As of 1879, the winery has won a number of different medals and awards.</p>
              <p>Château Preuillac earned well-deserved recognition in 1932 when it is included in the Crus Bourgeois classification created that year.</p>
              <p>Château Preuillac which was already a 30 hectares estate, was taken over by Raymond Bouët, who initiated a major overhaul of the state vineyards, construction of a winery and an underground cellar that go into service in 1975 .The underground cellar covering 200m2 hence became a unique structure in the Médoc appellation.</p>
              <p>Construction completed in 1980 in the 18th Century style.</p>
              <p>The Mau and Dirkzwager families successfully bought over the estate in 1998.</p>
              <p>Major renovation work is undertaken throughout the winery and the vineyard which is a boost for Château Preuillac to shine and excel towards a further goal.</p>
